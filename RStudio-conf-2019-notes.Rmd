# Workshop: What they forgot to tell you about R

## Day 1
### Sessions 1-2
Here are some notes:

* jack handy:
* Figuring out library and library structures
  + `.libPaths()`
  + `installed.packages()`
  + `01_explore-libraries_jenny.R`
  
* Use relative paths
  + use `here::here()`
  + `fs::path_real()` -> for following symbolic links
  
* Naming things
  + machine readable - no spaces, no non-ascii
  + human readable - stuff.R, thisissomesillyexampleofasillyfilename.txt
  + sort nicely - prefix-01, dates yyyy-mm-dd (ISO 8601), common sense

* Safer way to source files than `source()`
  + `callr` package


### Sessions 3-4
Here are some notes:

* Debugging in R with Jim Hester
  + google the `exact` error message
  + Keyword search comminity.rstudio.com
  + StackOverflow - [r] tag
* Useful functions
  + `traceback()`
  + `print()`, `cat()`, `str()` -> use str() more than print()
  + `browser()`
  + `debug()`, `trace()`, `recover()`
  + `options(error = traceback)` -> automatically print `traceback()`
  + `options(error = recover)` -> choose which level of call stack to enter browser
  + where inside `browser()` -> gives call stack

* Useful functions
  + [github.com/cran](https://github.com/cran) -> CRAN as github for viewing
  + [github.com/search](https://github.com/search)
    + search window: "Error 'x' is non-numeric" repo:wch/r-source
  + [github.com/wch/r-source](https://github.com/wch/r-source)
  + lookup package finds source code of a function on GitHub
    + `devtools::install_github("jimhester/lookup")`

* De-centralized Version Congrol w `GitHub`
  + Multiple users
* R scripts can be rendered by hitting the "notebook" icon at top (next to `knit` icon)
  + This is called "render to markdown"
  + You can then click on the file in GitHub and it's rendered nicely, not
    as an HTML page.
  

## Day 2
### Sessions 1-2
* Setting up `.Rprofile` and `.Renviron`
  + Multiple users
* GitHub personal access token (PAT)
  + setup and using outside of SSH
* More detailed version of `.Rpofile`
  + set up personalized startup message
  + `.First` and `.Last`
  + use of the `cowsay` package
* Maintaining `R`
  + Update packages -> most recent versions
  + `devtools::upgrade_packages("pkgname")` -> remembers where pkg came from, e.g. github
  + Reinstalling from scrtach
  + `pkgs <- installed.packages(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")) %>% tibble::as_tibble()`
  + Then filter `pkgs` for only pkgs not provided as `base` or `recommended`
  + `install.packages("pkgs")`

#### R Infrastructure
* R Infrastructure (Jeroen Ooms)
  + The `R` universe actually depends on numerous external system level libraries
    + `BLAS` and `LAPACK` packages, highly optimized linear algebra, FORTRAN
    + `LIBCURL` package, anything networking and server related
    + `PCRE` Peal Compatible Regular Expressions; all things regex
    + `CAIRO` graphical rendering and R graphics device, `x11()` and `quartz()`
  + Linking to external libraries
    + `Linux`: Dynamic and managed by `apt` or `yum`
    + `MacOS/Windows`: Static (comes with install)
* R packages (CRAN and scalability)
  + Some R packages often depend on specific external libraries
  + are linked and available at the `CRAN` webpage for the package
* Tools, Imaging, Graphics and Vision
  + All quite common external open source libraries
  + e.g. `TESSERACT` performs OCR
  + Vision = detecting shapes in images, following players on soccer field, security, etc.
* Future work
  + `RTOOLS 40` -> compiled toolchain for building/updating external libraries
  + `RHUB` -> package testing (especially with compiled code), esp. cross platform, nice API
  + `devtools::check_rhub()` -> checks in `RHUB`

* Setting up a `dev` environment
  + `devtools::has_devel()`
  + Use `brew cask install r-app` at command line (*not* `brew install r`)
    + compiles package binaries
  + Try not to use `install.packages()` because you lose the installation
    tool chain and the reproducibility to create your environment
  + 
    + `devtools::install_dev()` -> installs GitHub development version if link
      exists in `URL` field of the DESCRIPTION file
    + `devtools::install_github()` -> install any package from GitHub; need repo location
      + `devtools::install_github("r-lib/glue")`   -> install latest head
      + `devtools::install_github("r-lib/glue@v1.2.0")` -> install version
      + `devtools::install_github("r-lib/glue@#81")` -> install specific
        version, not necessarily merged issues
    + `devtools::install_version()` -> install a specific version of a package
    + `devtools::install()` -> install a local repository; pass the path
  + Use the `library(x, lib.loc =)` argument when loading library from a 
    temporary location
    
### Sessions 3-4
* Git Workflows
  + "Fork & clone"
    ```
    git remote -v
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/jennybc/wtf-2019-rsc.git
    git pull upstream master --ff-only
    git push
    ```
    
* Major resource
  + [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Brian

* Branches
  + `Git` and time travel
  + `git checkout -b <branchname> SHA-1`
  + `git revert --no-edit HEAD` -> 1 commit
  + `git revert --no-edit SHA-1` -> a specific SHA-1
  
* Resetting
  + git reset <file> -> remove local changes
  + git reset --hard  -> undo all local changes with HEAD if *haven't* committed
  + git reset ~HEAD  -> undo all local changes with HEAD if *have* committed
    (`Git Squash`)
    
* Surgical Time Travel
  + `git cherry-pick SHA-1`  ->  pull in a specific commit into the current branch
  + `git checkout SHA-1 -- <file>` -> pull out a specific from a specific commit 
    into current branch
    
* Amend Commits
  + There is a "Amend previous commit" checkbox in the `RStudio` API
  + `git commit --amend -m "message"`
  
* Abort Merge  
  + `git merge --abort` -> oh S&#*t! abort the merge and figure out a plan

* Working with lists with `purrr`
  + `str(got_chars, max.level = 2, list.len = 4)`
  + `View(got_chars)`
  + `map_chr(got_chars, "playedBy", .default = NA)` -> if you have missing entries
  + `map_chr(got_chars, list("playedBy", 1L))` -> if you have > length 1 entries
  + `map_chr(got_chars, list("playedBy", 1L), .default = NA)` -> both challenges
  + `purrr::enframe()` -> learn about it ... might be useful

# `RStudio` Conference
## Day 1
* `RStudio`'s Growth
  + 1700 attendees in 2019
  + 1100 in 2018

* Concept of a "Data Compendium"
  + stratified agreed-upon project structure
  + Include a simple "DESCRIPTION"-like minimal file for dependencies
  + Include a `Dockerfile` to the compendium
  + Karthik Ram: [https://github.com/karthik](https://github.com/karthik)
  + `Drake` package -> Dataframes in R for (GNU) `Make`
    + instead of `Makefile`
  + `piggyback` package -> link binaries to specific GitHub versions
 
* `RStudio` IDE 1.2
  + SQL, Python, D3, Stan compatible -> all within `RStudio`
  + Python chunks are now non-independent -> can refer to variables from other chunks
  + D3 -> visualizations -> ex. `bubbles.js`
  + New Python functionality -> line-by-line execution
  + New Featues:
    + Background jobs -> don't have to wait for scrips to finish
      + Use "source as local job" (dropdown menu)
      + Can run multiple simultaneous jobs
    + Auto-installation of missing R packages
      + analsis of R script for libraries not installed -> appears at top of scripter
    + Rmarkdown -> PowerPoint (dropdown menu)
    + Custom themes -> nightowl

* `RStudio` Package Manager (Sean Lopp)
  + managing central repository
  + automatic versioning
  + CRAN, curated CRAN, local pkgs, GitHub
  + usage metrics
  + `countdeps::countdeps()`
  + `rstd.io/countdeps`
  
* `RStudio` Job Launcher
  + launch independent jobs to a server without waiting within the IDE
  + For use with `RStudio` Server product line
  + Future releases of `RStudio` will trickle down various levels
  
* The `mlflow` platform
  + for managing machine learning workflows
    1. keeps track of what you did
    1. bundles your project for reproducibility
    1. models
    
* Democratizing `RStudio` API
  + James Blair (Software engineer @ `RStudio`)
  + Using the `plumber` package
    + Create API endpoints for any arbitrary R functions
    + Uses `roxygen` style tags (`#*`) to identify `plumber`
      specific commants/control sequences
    + Functions with `OpenAPI` under the hood
    + Works well with `JSON` and `YAML`
  + Similar to `Shiny Apps` provided to end users
  + Facilitates hand-off between R developers of Shiny Apps to software
    engineers who typically want programatic access
    + `Plumber` can facilitate this transition
  + The talk [https://github.com/sol-eng/plumber-model](https://github.com/sol-eng/plumber-model)
  + **Example**: created a quick predict model that a Swift App developer was 
    easily able to turn into a phone App, where the developer had no idea how
    to use `R`.

* Model representaion with `Broom`  
  + Alex Hayes
  + No uniform convension or standard for model object shapes
  + `broom::tidy()` -> returns tibble of model `summary()` -> rows == parameters
    + also hase a `CI=` argument
  + `broom::glance()` -> 1 row tibble
  + `broom::augment()` -> add infomation about observations to a dataset
  
* Tensor flow eager execution
  + `Keras` functional API
  + Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
  + Variational auto-encoders (VAEs)
  
* Karl Broman
  + rewriting a very old R pkg -> R/qtl (quantitative trait loci)
  + Hilarious ...
  + Long-term story of an old package, mistakes made, all sorts of hilarious
    what-not-to-do anecdotes
  
* The `gganimate()` cookbook
  + Thomas Lin Pedersen
  + a grammar of animated graphics -> extension of `ggplot2`
  + Three types:
    + transitions -> move fig from one to the other
    + views -> change viewpoint
    + shadows -> memory of the previous state to create trails on points
  + A [Getting started guide](www.gganimate.com)
  + Interpolates data to ensure animation is smooth -> corrects frame rate on the fly


## Day 2
