#' In a temporary library, do the following.
## Before each installation restart R to avoid errors due to having the
## previous version installed.

#' Install the ps _source_ package from CRAN
## Hint: use `install.packages()` `type` argument

#' Load the package from the temporary library and try running `ps()`
## The argument to `library` is `lib.loc`

#' Install the develpment version of the ps package
## You can use either `install_dev()` or `install_github()`
## Be sure to specify the `lib` argument

#' Install version 1.2.0 of the ps package from CRAN
## Use install_version()

#' Stretch goal
## If that went well try installing the source version of git2r.
## git2r has more complicated dependencies and takes longer to compile, but
## it should install without problems
